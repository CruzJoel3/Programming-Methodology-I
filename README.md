This Programming-Methodology-I repository shows all the codes I created from scratch for the course I took which taught C++. 

The exercises started off simple, and grew harder as the course progressed. 

For these exercises, we were not allowed to use any built-in functions that would do most of the work for us. So there will only be occasional instances of such methods, and most of these problems were done through critical thinking and understanding of coding logic.

Any code from this repository can be copied into any C++ compiler
