/*
 The Internet and the web enable people to network, join a cause,
and so on. The presidential candidates in 2016 used the Internet to get out
their messages and raise money. In this exercise, youâ€™ll write a polling
program that allows users to rate five social-consciousness issues on a scale of
1 to 10 (most important). Pick five causes (e.g., political issues, global
environmental issues). Use a one-dimensional string array topics to store the
causes. To summarize the survey responses, use a 5-row, 10-column
two-dimensional array responses (of type int ), each row corresponding to an
element in the topics array . When the program runs, it should ask the user to
rate each issue. Have your friends and family respond to the survey. Then
have the program display a summary of the results, including:

a. A tabular report with the five topics down the left side and the 10
ratings across the top, listing in each column the number of ratings
received for each topic.
b. To the right of each row, show the average of the ratings for that issue.
