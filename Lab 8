/*
(Salary Classification) A company pays its salespeople on a commission basis. The salespeople each
receive $200 per week plus 9 percent of their gross sales for that week. For example, a salesperson who
grosses $5000 in sales in a week receives $200 plus 9 percent of$5000,or a total of $650. Write a
program (using an array of counters) that determines how many of the salespeople earned salaries in
each of the following ranges (assume that each salesperson’s salary is truncated to an integer amount):
a)$200–299 b)$300–399 c)$400–499 d) $500–599 e) $600–699 f) $700–799 g) $800–899 h) $900–999
i) $1000 and over. 

NOTE:
Please use pointers instead of a static array.
