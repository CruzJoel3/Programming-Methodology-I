/*
Develop a C++ program that uses a while statement to determine the 
gross pay for each of several employees. The company pays “straight 
time” for the first 40 hours worked by each employee and pays “time-and-a-half”
for all hours worked in excess of 40 hours. You are given a list of 
the employees of the company, the number of hours each employee worked last week
and the hourly rate of each employee. Your program should input this
information for each employee and should determine and display the 
employee's gross pay
