/*
Write a program that plays the game of “guess the number” as follows:

Your program chooses the number to be guessed by selecting an integer
at random in the range 1 to 1000. The player then types a first guess. 
If the player’s guess is incorrect, your program should loop until the 
player finally gets the number right. Your program should keep telling 
the player Too high or Too low to help the player “zero in” on the correct 
answer.
